Nikolai Reinke, Tobias Wursthorn and Jan Jessen from the Digital Reality master’s program won the “Student Game Competition” at the ACM CHI Conference.

Their game "MEDUSA - A View-Tracking Pong Game" convinced the jury with its innovative interface, which includes the player's eyes in the gameplay. The project was created during the module "Human-Computer Interaction" with Prof. Dr. Eike Langbehn.

The ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems is the most important international conference in the field of human-computer interaction and took place from April 23 to 28, 2023 with over 4,000 participants in the Congress Center Hamburg.
